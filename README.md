## Key Features:

- **Accurate Mortality Estimation:** Utilize advanced statistical methods to estimate the mortality rates of policyholders based on demographic and historical data.

- **Present Value Calculation:** Calculate the probable present value (PVV) of a life annuity product, incorporating the estimated mortality rates.

- **Portfolio Analysis:** Analyze the mortality rates and present value estimates for different segments of the policyholder portfolio.

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Visualize the results to gain deeper insights into the mortality patterns and financial implications.
